# HushHear
Silence your least favorite sounds

# How to develop
You need:
- A Windows / Linux machine
- NodeJS LTS
- Git
- A pair of hands
- A brain, preferably working one

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:xlspring/hushhear.git
```
Switch to the folder and to the `dev branch`:
```bash
cd ./hushhear
git switch dev
```
Make a branch for your feature:
```bash
git branch XXX
git switch XXX
```
Code your things, then push to remote and open a pull request to the `dev` branch
Voila
